					"content": "Hooks are used as ways to execute custom code during various points of Mavo's execution. The name of the hook gives a summary of where the hook will be executed and usually follows the scheme `\"CLASS_NAME-METHOD_NAME-LOCATION\"`.\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Hook name | Executes | Definition |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [mavo.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/mavo.js#L58) |\n| `node-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Node` constructor, after a few properties have been initialized. | [node.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/node.js#L45) |\n| `group-init-start` | At the start of the `Mavo.Group` constructor, after its parent constructor (`Mavo.Node`) has been called. | [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L11) |\n| `node-getdata-end` | Called right before `getData()` returns its value, to give plugins a chance to intercept and manipulate it. Note that a hook can be called multiple times in different places. | [collection.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/collection.js#L80) [group.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/group.js#L125) [primitive.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/primitive.js#L236) |\n\nNote: Links to the source code might not link to the exact hook definition as the code changes. Look a few lines above or below, it should be close.\n\n## Adding code to a hook\n\nYou can add a hook by calling `Mavo.hooks.add(\"hook-name\", callback)`. If you have multiple hooks, you can also pass an object, like so:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.hooks.add({\n\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nYou could also add code to hooks as one of the options in `Mavo.Plugins.register()`:\n\n```\n\n\t\t\tMavo.plugins.register(\"myplugin\", {\n\t\t\t\thooks: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook1-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 1 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\"hook2-name\": function(env) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// hook 2 callback\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\n```\n\nThe `env` object differs depending on the hook. For hooks run in instance methods of classes, `env` is an object that contains references to all important local variables so you can modify them in your plugin. If there are none, it just refers to the current instance. The context of the function (the `this` variable) is the current instance. This means that you could use a custom build of Mavo to experiment, then copy over your code to hooks without having to make changes to it.\n\n## Available hooks\n\nMavo calls `Mavo.hooks.run(\"hook-name\", data)` to run the code added at a hook. Therefore, you can [search Mavo’s code for `Mavo.hooks.run(`](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Mavo.hooks.run%28&type=) and you will find all available hooks as well as where in the code they are executed.\n\nYou never need to run `Mavo.hooks.run()` yourself, unless you want to create hooks for your own plugin, i.e. allow other people to create plugins of your plugin (\"metaplugins\"? \"pluginception\"? 😜). In that case please prefix the hook names with your plugin id, to prevent collisions with other plugins.\n\n## Limitations\n\nHooks cannot change the return value of a function, unless the calling code has enabled that via a property on `env`. For example, in the `node-getdata-end` hook described above, all you need to do to change the return value is modify `env.data`.\n\nIn the future this may become possible, so avoid returning non-undefined values from your callbacks to make sure your plugin doesn’t break when this is enabled.\n\n## Need a hook that doesn’t exist yet?\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/issues/new) and chances are we’ll add it pretty soon. Make sure to describe what you’re trying to do!"

When a Mavo allows login but the current user is not logged in, `mv-permissions` will include the value `login`. You can use this in your CSS to style things differently based on whether the current user is logged in.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an `auth` class and you want to only show anything with that class to authenticated users. You can do this with this CSS:\n\n```css\n\n\t\t[mv-permissions~=\"login\"] .auth {\n\t\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t\t}\n\n```\n\nNote the [`~=` in the attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) above. This allows you to match for one value in a space-separated list, instead of the entire attribute.\n\nFor convenience, there are also `mv-logged-in` and `mv-logged-out` classes that you can use on your HTML to show things only to logged in or logged out users respectively."

					"id": "bar",

It’s typically specified on the Mavo root. Buttons are represented by their ids. You can find the ids of the built-in buttons below, but keep in mind that [Plugins](https://plugins.mavo.io) may add more:\n\n| id | Default? | Button |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| status | ✓ | Displays currently logged in info for backends that support login |\n| edit | ✓ | Edit button |\n| save | ✓ | Save button |\n| import | | Upload a JSON file and override current data. |\n| export | | Download current data as a JSON file. |\n| login | ✓ | Login button |\n| logout | ✓ | Logout button |\n\nJust including a series of ids in the `mv-bar` attribute **restricts the toolbar to these buttons, in that order**.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"import export edit save\">\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever, often we only want to **add or remove a few buttons to the default set**. With the syntax above, we would need to remember all default ids and their default order in order to specify the buttons we want. This is why `mv-bar` also supports a **relative** syntax: by starting the value with `with` all values are interpreted as relative to the default set of buttons. You can then remove buttons by using a `no-` prefix and add buttons by just specifying their ids.\n\nNote that the edit button is still there, even though we didn't have to explicitly specify it.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\" mv-bar=\"with import export no-save\"> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote: The `with` keyword can be omitted if there’s at least one `no-*`.\n\nTip: Want to **hide the Mavo bar from logged out users**? Use `mv-bar=\"no-login\"`. You can still log in without a Mavo toolbar, by adding `?login` to the page URL. Note that browsers often block popups more aggressively when they are not triggered by a click so you may need to manually approve the authentication popup when using this.\n\n# Hide the toolbar completely\n\nUse `mv-bar=\"none\"`. You can then use classes like `mv-status`, `mv-edit`, `mv-save`, `mv-clear`, `mv-login`, `mv-logout` etc on your own buttons to provide the corresponding functionality. However, note that if you choose to go this route, **these buttons will be always shown**, regardless of whether the user has permission for the corresponding action. You can use an `mv-permissions` attribute selector to fix this.\n\n# Change its placement and/or use your own HTML element for it\n\nJust use `class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\"` on your desired element.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\" style=\"background: blue\">\n\t\tYOLO\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n# Remove default styling\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and omit the `mv-ui` class:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\"> \n\t<div class=\"mv-bar\">YOLO</div> \n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div> \n</div>\n```\n\nThis is useful when you want a completely different styling and would rather start from a blank state. You can see a real example of custom toolbar styling on the [SVG Paths](/demos/svgpath) demo.\n\n# Custom button elements\n\nFollow the process above for using a custom toolbar element, and include your custom button inside it with the appropriate `mv-BUTTON_ID` class. For example, to have a Save button with the text \"Store\" instead of \"Save\", you could do:\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<div mv-app mv-storage=\"local\">\n\t<div class=\"mv-bar mv-ui\">\n\t\t<button class=\"mv-save\">Store</button>\n\t</div>\n\t<div property=\"name\">Lea</div>\n</div>\n```"

Please note that `lang` is not a Mavo attribute, it’s an HTML attribute and its values are described in any HTML documentation.\n\nWarning: Please try to avoid locales with hyphens unless you absolutely need to. E.g. it's better to define a general French (`lang=\"fr\"`) locale and another Canadian French (Québécois) locale (`lang=\"fr-ca\"`) with only the phrases that are different. The reason is that any French dialect can fall back to general French, but not to a specific dialect of French, which means that even if you have defined a locale for `fr-ca`, apps with `lang=\"fr\"` will be displayed in English.\n\nWarning: Please note that this datalist element is **static**, i.e. changes to its contents via scripts or expressions will not be picked up.\n\nFor a list of ids and phrases that you can copy as a starting point, use [src/locale.en.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/locale.en.js), however note that plugins can also define their own phrases.\n\n# Advanced: Customizing text via JavaScript\n\nYou can write your own localization plugin, by using `Mavo.Locale.register(languageCode, phrases)`. For an example, you can look at the [Greek localization plugin](https://plugins.mavo.io/locale-el/mavo-locale-el.js).\n\nIf you go that route, please consider adding your plugin to the [Plugins directory](https://plugins.mavo.io) so that others can benefit too!

If the CSS selector matches multiple elements on the page, the first one will be used. The element you linked to remains intact. Instead, it is cloned for the editing. If the original element changes (e.g. perhaps that's also populated by Mavo!

Its value is either the name of the attribute that holds data, or `none` for no attribute (element contents).\n\nFor example, an `<a>` element's primary data attribute is `href`. However, sometimes you want to make the content editable instead, and even reference it in the `href` attribute via an expression.

This is why things like `count(rating > 3)` work in MavoScript, but wouldn't in JS. |\n| All strings have to be quoted | Strings that only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores don't need quotes. |\n| `==` operator for equality | `=` operator for equality |\n| `&&` operator for logical and | `and` operator for logical and |\n| `\\|\\|`  operator for logical or | `or` operator for logical or |\n| `%` operator for remainder | `mod` operator for remainder |\n| `if` is a control structure | `if()` is a function |\n| `a + b` might be addition or concatenation depending on types | `a + b` is always addition, `a & b` is concatenation |\n| Things like `3 > 2 > 1` return unexpected results (`false` in this case) | Every operator can have multiple operands, including `>`, so `3 > 2 > 1` has the same result as in math (`true`) |\n| `foo.bar.baz` will throw an error if either `foo` or `foo.bar` don’t exist. | If either `foo` or `foo.bar` don’t exist, `foo.bar.baz` will just return `\"\"`. |\n\nSince MavoScript does not support comments, an easy way to force JS mode is a `/* js */` comment in the start or end of the expression."

					"content": "By default, Mavo expressions are delineated by square brackets, e.g. `[5 + 5]`. We explored many different syntaxes and found that format to have the best readability. However, if you are concerned about potential false positives, you can change that with the `mv-expressions` attribute. For example, to switch to a double curly brace syntax (common in many other systems), you can use `mv-expressions=\"{{ }}\"`. To disable expressions in an element and its descendants altogether, use `mv-expressions=\"none\"`.\n\nIf you are concerned about the expression content being shown while the page loads, you can use the [`mv-value`](#mv-value) attribute instead, and provide a fallback as content.\n\n##### Example: Using mv-value\n\n```html\n<p>Slider value: <span mv-value=\"strength\">0</span>/100</p>\n<input type=\"range\" property=\"strength\" />\n```\n\nNote: `mv-value` does not require braces or whatever other syntax you have defined, and including them could result in unpredictable behavior. Also `mv-value` will work even when you specify `mv-expressions=\"none\"` (from v0.1.5).\n\nIf your expression contains a mistake, the expression itself will be shown instead of a result. If you’re using `mv-value` however, its fallback content will be shown instead.\n\n##### Example: Incorrect expressions\n\n```html\n[5 +]\n<div mv-value=\"5 +\">Fallback</div>\n```"

For example, `[sum(age + 5)]` will add 5 to every age and then sum the result. You can use either symbols (e.g. `+`, `*`, `>`, `==`) etc to perform these operations, or [their function counterparts](/docs/mavoscript/#math-functions)."

The second parameter is optional: If you omit it, nothing will be printed out if the condition is false.\n\nThe `if()` function is very powerful, but can be confusing when all you want is to toggle content. For this, you can also use the `mv-if` attribute to hide or show content based on the value of an expression. Just like `mv-value`, `mv-if` does not require braces or other syntax. Besides readability, `mv-if` has another benefit: elements hidden with it are completely removed from the page, not just hidden.\n\n##### Example\n\n```html\n<style>\n.bad { background: #fdd; }\n.ok { background: #ffd; }\n.good { background: #dfc; }\n</style>\n<div mv-app class=\"[if(rating < 3, bad, if(rating > 3, good, ok))]\">\n\t<label>Rating:\n\t\t<input property=\"rating\" type=\"range\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" />\n\t</label>\n\n\t<p mv-if=\"rating = 1\">Wow, you hated that movie!</p>\n\t<p mv-if=\"rating > 3\">Glad you liked it!</p>\n</div>\n<style>\ndiv { padding: 2em; }\n</style>\n```"

Mavo will provide login controls and will not allow any edits until the viewer has logged in. If the file and/or repo does not exist, Mavo will create it upon saving.\n\nIf the logged in user **does have commit permission** (i.e. is either the creator of the repo or added as a collaborator), saving will directly save back to Github. If the logged in user **does not have commit permissions**, the data will be stored in their own profile and they will be prompted to send an _\"edit suggestion\"_ to the original owner of the data. Editing suggestions are sent as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), with a link to view the new data in the Mavo app (by using the [`storage` URL parameter described below](#url-params)). Currently reviewing the changes between the new and old data (i.e. the _diff_) requires the ability to read JSON (unless you’re using a different format for your data). Future Mavo versions may introduce a graphical way for this as well.\n\n**You don’t need to understand how Github works to use it for storing your data.** If you don’t know what a repo or a branch is, do not worry. Just sign up for a [Github](http://github.com) account, and specify `https://github.com/USERNAME` as the value of the `mv-storage` attribute. Mavo will automatically create an `mv-data` repo for you and a file to store your data named `APP_ID.json` where `APP_ID` is the [name of your app](/docs/primer/#mv-app).\n\nIf you _do_ understand how Github works, you can specify where your data should be stored with more precision:\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>Mavo will create a file called <code>APP_ID.json</code> in that repository.</dd>\n\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/FILE_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>Mavo will assume a default branch of <code>master</code></dd>\n\n\t<dt><code>https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/blob/BRANCH/FILE_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>The URL Github gives you when using its file browser. As specific as it gets, Mavo makes no assumptions.</dd>\n\n\t<dt><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/BRANCH/FILE_NAME</code></dt>\n\t<dd>The URL that shows when you click the button Raw from the Github file browser.</dd>\n</dl>\n\nTerms in `UPPERCASE_AND_ITALIC` indicate that you are expected to replace them with the actual values (e.g. your username). Note that __FILE_NAME__ above could include a path, e.g. `foo/bar/baz.json`.\n\nGithub Pages URLs (`https://_USERNAME_.github.io/_REPO_NAME_/_FILE_NAME_`) are not supported, because it’s impossible for Mavo to figure out where to save the data just from the Github Pages URL."

You can read more about [`Mavo.Permissions` in the API documentation](/docs/api/#permissions).\n\nIn case you’re writing a backend for a JSON-based OAuth 2 service, `Mavo.Backend` includes many helpers to make this as easy as possible. Take a look at the following in the API documentation:\n\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#accessToken`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#accessToken)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#isAuthenticated`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#isAuthenticated)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthenticate`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthenticate)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthLogout`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthLogout)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#oAuthParams`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#oAuthParams)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend#request`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend#request)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend.apiDomain`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend.apiDomain)\n*   [`Mavo.Backend.oAuth`](/docs/api/#Mavo.Backend.oAuth)\n\nAnother helpful function you may write if your backend supports authentication, is the `getUser` function, which should make the API call to get user information and set `this.user`. You **must** set `this.user` **before** setting the `logout` permission to show user information in the Mavo toolbar.\n\n```js\ngetUser: function() {\n\tif (this.user) {\n\t\treturn Promise.resolve(this.user);\n\t}\n\n\treturn this.request(\"user\").then(info => {\n\t\tthis.user = { // replace the following fields with how you get username, name, profile picture, etc\n\t\t\tusername: info.getUsernameHere,\n\t\t\tname: info.getNameHere,\n\t\t\tavatar: info.getProfilePictureHere,\n\t\t\tinfo // raw info object\n\t\t};\n\n\t\t$.fire(this.mavo.element, \"mavo:login\", { backend: this });\n\t});\n},\n```\n\nYou can see examples of backend declarations in [src/backend.github.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.github.js), [src/backend.dropbox.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.dropbox.js) and [src/backend.js](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/blob/master/src/backend.js)\n\nIf your backend may be useful to other people, please consider adding it to the [Plugin directory](https://plugins.mavo.io)!"
